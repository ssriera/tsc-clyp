              A private Clyp will not be searchable and will never show up on any of our curated lists. We respect your privacy. However, anyone you share the link with will be able to access your Clyp.

              Are there any upload/recording limitations?
            </h3>
            <p>
              We limit audio uploads by file size, not by file length. Some audio file types are larger in nature compared to others. For example, a 128kbps mp3 file is going to be much smaller in size when compared to a .WAV file. The file size limit per upload is 100mb, which works out to about an hour if you're uploading an mp3 file.

              How do I share my Clyp to Facebook?
            </h3>
            <p>
              To share a Clyp to Facebook, just hit the Facebook icon on the player page. A popup will appear after you hit the Facebook icon and you can say whatever you want about the Clyp in your post. Alternatively, you can just copy and paste the short URL into your Facebook status. On the apps, you have the option of sharing directly to Facebook whenever you're adding in a title and description to your Clyp - just tap the small Facebook icon. You can also share it once you've uploaded your Clyp by tapping the share arrow icon and selecting Facebook.

              It's basically the same approach as Facebook. You can click the Twitter logo on the player page or copy the link directly into a Tweet. You can also share via the apps with the same approach.
